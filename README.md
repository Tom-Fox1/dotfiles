# dotfiles

This repository holds all my BASH configurations and aliases

## Why

Recently I started messing around with the terminal. I always knew about the bash_profile but nothing related to aliases. So after some digging I learned more about aliases and I'm blown away. Aliases can save up so much time using the terminal. After creating my own bash_profile with aliases I decided to open source it.

My configuration is really simple for now and as I'm learning new things and update my bash_profile, I'm gonna update this repo as well.

## Setup

To clone the repo, do the following

1. `cd`
1. `git clone https://github.com/agisilaos/dotfiles`
1. `ln -s ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile`
